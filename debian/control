Description: helps download, update and run the Tor Browser Bundle
 Tor Browser Launcher is intended to make the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) easier
 to maintain and use for GNU/Linux users. torbrowser-launcher handles
 downloading the most recent version of TBB for you, in your language and for
 your architecture. It also adds a "Tor Browser" application launcher to your
 operating system's menu.
 .
 When you first launch Tor Browser Launcher, it will download TBB from
 https://www.torproject.org/ and extract it to ~/.local/share/torbrowser,
 and then execute it.
 Cache and configuration files will be stored in ~/.cache/torbrowser and
 ~/.config/torbrowser.
 Each subsequent execution after installation will simply launch the most
 recent TBB. Tor Browser will be fetched, verified and unpacked each time a new
 version of TBB is released. When you open Tor Browser Launcher after an update,
 it will download the newer version of TBB for you and extract it over your old
 TBB directory in ~/.local/share/torbrowser, so you will maintain your TBB
 bookmarks.
